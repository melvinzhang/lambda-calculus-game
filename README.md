# Lambda calculus as a puzzle game

The lambda calculus has a very simple core which can serve as the core mechanic
of a puzzle game. The player is given a series of input/output and he/she has
to come up with the combinator with the desired functionality.

# Ideas

* A combinator is a one-time clone machine. It takes an input and clones it, the
original input is destroyed.

* Give names to combinators created in earlier levels so that it can reused in
later levels. Add these named combinators to the player's toolbox.

* Allow players to create and share levels (suggested by Danien).

* [Levels](levels.md)

# Questions

* What is a good metaphor for combinators and how to represent them visually?

* How to create combinators with a visual interface?
